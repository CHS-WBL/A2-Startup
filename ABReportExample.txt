	Our website will be A/B testing our website’s homepage as first impressions mean a lot to a customer. Currently, our homepage has a description of what can be found on our website with an image below it. We propose that there is a homepage that exists that leads to more people to go to our sign-up page and request a quote than our current numbers.
	I propose the idea of instead of having the random photo display currently on the site, we feature a sneak peek of our blog. To get the person to stay on the website they will be enticed by the blog. This would be tested in two ways. These would be if we were to add this feature just above the slide show or the slide show would simply be replaced with the blog preview. To measure success we can test if this increases traffic to our sign up page as well as increases in sign-ups themselves. To minimize external factors, no other sign elements will be changed. This would mean we would try our best to not post a blog post out of the ordinary, not run promotions, and not make other major site changes during this testing process.
	To help keep the results unbiased, the customers involved will be chosen at random, fifty percent receiving the original version and the other fifty percent getting the homepage with the blog preview.
	If we were to implement this we would conduct this test using software that automatically displays both versions of the website, consistently. This would mean the software would keep track of who gets which site and record the user’s actions. By changing our homepage to one of the already most successful pages of our site will help promote sales. This permanent change will be up to the customer and what the data says of their actions.
